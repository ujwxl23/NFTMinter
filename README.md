This is a NFTMinter application built using ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB and ethers v5. This application allows new users and private users mint NFT. The application gets the addresses stored off-chain in the MongoDB database and using an GET API to fetch all the private addresses. Also, dynamically changes the mint value depending on it. 
The contract is deployed in the sepolia network of ethereum.  

The backend server and MongoDb database is working perfectly to dynamically get the addresses.
